      <h2 class="font-bold font-mono text-xl">About me</h2>
      <ul class="list-none list-inside font-mono">
        <li>
          I've been working in and around back-end/full-stack development since
          2018, originally in Python, in more recent years expanding into
          JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and (to a lesser extent) Go. I've always
          enjoyed the art of problem solving in an efficient and repeatable way
          using the power of code and love keeping up to date with new
          frameworks, libraries and approaches, to apply them in my own work.
        </li>
        <li>
          I've spent considerable time building solutions using cloud providers,
          namely ðŸ§° [AWS, GCP] and I'm certified as an Associate Cloud Engineer
          for Google Cloud. My experience includes: building data
          pipelines/workflow automation; setting up serverless functions and
          containers; user administration; object storage; SQL database
          administration and ETL; CI/CD.
        </li>
        <li>
          I enjoy the design aspect of development, with an emphasis on a
          simple, consistent design language which is equal parts intuitive to
          use and visually engaging. Where possible, I create my own simple
          graphics/mock-ups in ðŸ§° [Affinity Designer] to add
          character/originality to my programs, such as the SplitDash logo and
          all the dashboard template designs in the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          As you may've deduced from my hobby projects, I speedrun old games
          when I find the time, occasionally streaming my runs on Twitch or
          creating related content in the form of YouTube videos. I've picked up
          some fun, albeit maybe tangential skills in video recording ðŸ§° [OBS]
          and editing ðŸ§° [DaVinci Resolve], and livestream coordination skills,
          such as community engagement, overlay composition, layouts etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
